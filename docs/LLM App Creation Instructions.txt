I want to create a turnkey, integrated RAG system with MCP server and UI.  This will be a self-contained Electron app
with all code embedded.  

** RAG **
- will use a vector store built on SQLite, stored in ~/froggy-rag-mcp/data
- will have world-class chunking ability for .docx, .xlsx, .pdf, .csv, .txt.
- The system will process documents in a queue, allowing documents to be ingested and chunked semi-offline.  it will maintain status of ingestion for each document.
- documents themselves will not be stored except as chunk in the vector store.

** Retrieval **
- world-class matching based upon input and vector store.  

** MCP Server **
- Implement both stio and REST interfaces.
- Implement tools suitable for RAG

** UI **
- Header bar at top wirh label "Froggy RAG MCP".
- Tree on the left with sizable vertical splitter (position is persisted).
    - tree will initially contain four roots: Ingestion, Vector Store, Search, and Server.
	    - Ingestion: will have two child elements: Files and Directories
            - Files - Selecting Files opens a canvas for managing files to be ingested/changed/deleted/watched.
  			    - Files can be dragged onto a grid, or added via button.  Button exists to remove as well in each row.
			    - Each file can be monitored for changes for automatic re-ingestion.  Checkbox in each row to specify.
			    - Files added/changed will be added to the RAG queue for processing.  
			    - The files grid shows the current ingestion status of each file.
            - Directories - Selecting Directories opens a canvas for managing directories to be ingested/managed/watched.
                - Directories can be added and removed using buttons or by dragging one onto the grid.
                - Directories have a checkbox on each row to specify whether it should be watched.
                - If watched, vector store is updated along with directory updates (files within that path)
                - Directories can be watched recursively, specified via checkbox in each row.
            - These settings will be persisted.
		- Vector Store: will show the status/metrics for the vector store.
		    - Show list of documents in vector store
			- clicking on document shows chunks for that document in a grid.
			- clicking on a document chunk will show its content and metadata
		- Search: will have a search box with MRU.  
            - Typing and pressing Enter (or search button) will initiate search.
		    - search will use our retrieval algorithm and display matching chunks
			- clickung on a result chunk will show its content and metadata
		- Server: will allow the server to be started/stopped and show a log of requests, etc.
